# Functionality and Development

```
- client needed a website to sell products and display information about their event
- I leveraged Shopify's storefront api to create a custom ecommerce experience
- Nextjs was used to create a static site that would be able to fetch data from the Shopify api and strapi api
- Strapi was used to create a headless cms that would allow the client to update their event information, while also allowing me to fetch the data from the cms to display on the website
- two graphql queries were created to fetch data from the cms and the shopify api
- all custom tailwindcss components were created to style the website and to display the data from the graphql queries
- the website is fully responsive and mobile friendly
- the website is fully functional and is currently live at https://twisteddreamshaunt.com/
```

# Current State

```
- User is currently able to visit the site and see a directory of products

- user is able to log in through google strategy OAuth or django authentication

- user is able to click on any of the product displayed to view full information

- if user is logged in they will have access to be able to add item to their cart and checkout

- if user is logged in on the product they are viewing they are able to add a comment

- user will be able to see their comments added to the product they commented on
```
